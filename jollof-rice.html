   <h3> Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
       <li> Core and coarsely chop the 3 medium red tomatoes. Place in a blender.Trim and coarsely chop 1 large red bell pepper. Add to the blender and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
        Prepare the following, adding each to the blender as you complete it: Coarsely chop 1/2 large red onion, peel 1-inch piece ginger and coarsely chop (about 1 tablespoon), trim the stem from 1/2 to 1 habanero pepper, add 5 garlic cloves and blend on high speed until smooth, about 1 minute.
        Pour the mixture into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. The mixture will thicken slightly and turn bright red.
        For the jollof rice:</li>
       <li> Thinly slice 1/2 large red onion. Place 4 cups long-grain white rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly under cool running water. Set aside to drain.
        Heat 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onions and cook until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons curry powder, 4 fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 2 bay leaves. Stir and cook until the paste has darkened in color, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
       <li> Pour in the red pepper base and 3 cups stock. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer. Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.</li>
       <li> Add the rice and stir until combined. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with aluminum <li>foil and then the lid. Cook undisturbed for 30 minutes.</li>
        Remove the lid and foil and gently fluff the rice. Remove and discard the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. If the rice tastes a bit undercooked, remove from the heat, cover again, and let sit for 10 minutes. Do not worry if the rice burns a bit at the bottom of the pot. This is part of what contributes a smoky flavor to the dish, and some people actually prefer this part!</li>
